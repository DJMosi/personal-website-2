                <h1>How I Lost 80 lbs in One Year!</h1>
            		<p style="text-indent:50px;">Hi, my name is Drew. Just a few years ago I tipped the scale at the heaviest I'd ever been. I found myself asking how the hell I got to that point and what I can do to change my ways and get back to the shape I was in years past. I’d like to present you with the cliff notes of how I went through such a dramatic transformation and the one dieting trick that allowed me to burn fat faster than I thought was possible.</p>
				<h3>Summer to Fall 2011, From 255 lbs to 235 lbs - 20 lbs Lost!</h3>
					<p style="text-indent:50px;">After years of lifting weights prior to my weight gain, in the summer of 2011 I finally started to make some progress in my weight loss efforts; though I still hadn’t a clue what I was doing in the area of nutrition. That’s right, with a bunch of consecutive years lifting weights over the last six years or so at the time I had no education in the area of what foods are conducive for weight loss or building muscle for that matter.
					<br>
					That summer I found a low-key nearby track to circle the football field of after dark as I was jiggling around too much for the daytime and I was finally making progress as I continued to make a habit of it several nights a week. At first I was only able to walk a mile or two with the hopes of working up to a steady jog and longer distances but making the transition to jogging is damned tough as I found our bodies need to adjust to the constant pounding our feet, shins and legs receive. No matter what I did I couldn’t shake the shin splints as all two hundred and forty plus pounds of me was stuck jogging about a half a lap around the track before I had to walk again due to pain from shin splints. This was about the time I made my first major breakthrough in this sequence of battling my body fat. continued...
